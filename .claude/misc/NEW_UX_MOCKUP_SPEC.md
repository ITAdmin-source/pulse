# Pol.is-Style Voting Platform - Development Guide

## 1. Product Overview

### What We're Building
A mobile-first opinion polling platform that allows users to vote on statements, discover their voting profiles, and see group consensus. Think Pol.is meets Instagram Stories.

### Core Philosophy
- **Anonymous first, auth optional**: Users can vote immediately without login
- **Batch-based engagement**: Present statements in manageable chunks (10 at a time) to reduce overwhelm
- **Progressive disclosure**: Show features when relevant, not all at once
- **Reward participation**: Personal insights as emotional payoff for engagement

---

## 2. Key User Flows

### Flow 1: First-Time Voter (Open Poll)
```
Home ‚Üí Click Poll ‚Üí Vote on 10 statements ‚Üí Demographics Form ‚Üí 
See Results + Personal Insight ‚Üí Prompted to sign up ‚Üí Continue voting (optional)
```

### Flow 2: Returning Voter (Open Poll, 5 votes, has demographics)
```
Home ‚Üí Click Poll ‚Üí Resume at statement 6 ‚Üí Complete 10 minimum ‚Üí 
See Results ‚Üí Vote on next batch (optional)
```

### Flow 3: Returning Voter (Open Poll, 5 votes, no demographics yet)
```
Home ‚Üí Click Poll ‚Üí Resume at statement 6 ‚Üí Complete 10 minimum ‚Üí 
Demographics Form ‚Üí See Results
```

### Flow 4: Viewing Closed Poll (Participated)
```

See "You voted on 7/10 before closing" ‚Üí See personal insight
```

### Flow 5: Viewing Closed Poll (Never Participated)
```
Home ‚Üí Click Closed Poll ‚Üí Direct to Results ‚Üí 
See closure banner ‚Üí View group statistics only
```

## 3. Core UX Principles

### Principle 1: Keep It Simple
**Problem**: Too many options = decision paralysis  
**Solution**: 
- One clear action per screen
- "Vote Now" or "View Results" - never both
- No dropdown menus or hidden navigation

### Principle 2: Value Exchange Before Friction
**Problem**: Asking for data upfront kills engagement  
**Solution**: 
- Let users vote first (experience value)
- Gate Results with demographics form (fair exchange)
- Clear messaging: "Answer 4 questions to see your results"
- Collect demographics ONCE, never ask again

### Principle 2: Value Exchange Before Friction
**Problem**: Asking for data upfront kills engagement  
**Solution**: 
- Let users vote first (experience value)
- Gate Results with demographics form (fair exchange)
- Clear messaging: "Answer 4 questions to see your results"
- Collect demographics ONCE, never ask again

### Principle 3: Mobile-First Design
**Why**: 70%+ users on mobile  
**Implementation**:
- Touch targets minimum 44px
- Responsive text sizes (`text-sm sm:text-base`)
- Swipe-friendly interactions
- Stacked layouts on small screens

### Principle 4: Progressive Disclosure
**Don't show users what they can't access yet**

Examples:
- Results tab locked until 10 votes: `Results (7/10)`
- Vote tab hidden for closed polls
- Auth prompts shown at high-value moments, not immediately
- Demographics form shown only after minimum votes

### Principle 5: Clear Visual Hierarchy
**Status communication through design:**

| State | Visual Treatment | Button Text |
|-------|-----------------|-------------|
| Open poll | Full color, vibrant | "Vote Now" |
| Closed poll | 75% opacity, red badge | "View Results" |
| Current statement | Full color voting buttons | - |
| After voting | Stats appear on buttons | - |

---

## 4. Technical Architecture

### State Management

#### Poll-Level State
```javascript
{
  id: 'work-culture',
  title: 'Team Work Culture',
  isClosed: false,
  closedDate: null,
  statements: [...],
  participants: 36
}
```

#### User-Level State (Per Poll)
```javascript
{
  pollId: 'work-culture',
  votes: { 1: 'agree', 2: 'disagree', 5: 'pass' },
  currentStatementIndex: 7,
  currentBatch: 0
}
```

**Critical**: Each poll has its own voting state. Don't mix votes across polls.

### Batch System Logic

```javascript
const BATCH_SIZE = 10;

// Calculate current batch
const batchStart = currentBatch * BATCH_SIZE;
const batchEnd = Math.min(batchStart + BATCH_SIZE, statements.length);
const currentBatchStatements = statements.slice(batchStart, batchEnd);

// Check if more batches exist
const hasMoreBatches = batchEnd < statements.length;
```

**Why batches?**
- Reduces cognitive load (10 vs 100 statements)
- Creates natural stopping points
- Instagram-style progress bar stays clean (max 10 segments)

### Smart Routing Logic

**When user enters a poll:**
```javascript
if (poll.isClosed) {
  ‚Üí Go to Results (always)
} else if (userVotedCount >= 10) {
  ‚Üí Go to Results (reward for reaching minimum)
} else {
  ‚Üí Go to Vote (need to reach minimum first)
}
```

**Why this matters**: Sets user expectations correctly from entry.

## 5. The 6 Use Cases Matrix

| # | Poll State | User State | Entry Point | Available Views | Special Handling |
|---|------------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1 | Closed | Participated | Results only | Results | Show profile + "voted X/Y before closing" |
| 2 | Closed | Didn't participate | Results only | Results | Closure banner, no profile |
| 3 | Open | No votes, no demographics | Vote | Vote only | Results locked "(0/10)", demographics after 10 |
| 4 | Open | 1-9 votes, no demographics | Vote | Vote only | Results locked "(7/10)", demographics after 10 |
| 5 | Open | 10+ votes, has demographics | Results | Vote + Results | Both unlocked, starts at Results |
| 6 | Open | All done, has demographics | Results | Vote + Results | Celebration message + share |

**Developer note**: Test all 6 scenarios. Most bugs come from edge cases 1, 2, and 4.

**New critical flow**: After reaching 10 votes, if user has no demographics, show demographics form BEFORE Results.

---

## 6. Demographics Collection System

### Why Demographics?

To understand voting patterns across different demographic groups and provide users with insights like:
- "78% of your age group agrees with you"
- "Your views align with 60% of moderates"

### The Strategy: Gate Results, Not Entry

**DO:**
- ‚úÖ Let users vote first (10 statements minimum)
- ‚úÖ Show demographics form AFTER 10th vote, BEFORE Results
- ‚úÖ Frame as value exchange: "Help us understand our community"
- ‚úÖ Collect ONCE per user, never ask again
- ‚úÖ Make completion required (all 4 fields)
- ‚úÖ Include "Prefer not to say" option

**DON'T:**
- ‚ùå Ask before first vote (kills engagement)
- ‚ùå Make it optional (incomplete data is useless)
- ‚ùå Ask multiple times
- ‚ùå Ask creepy/invasive questions
- ‚ùå Link demographics to individual votes publicly

### The 4 Questions

```javascript
demographics: {
  gender: 'female' | 'male' | 'non-binary' | 'prefer-not-say',
  ageGroup: 'under-18' | '18-24' | '25-34' | '35-44' | '45-54' | '55-64' | '65+' | 'prefer-not-say',
  ethnicity: 'white' | 'black' | 'hispanic' | 'asian' | 'middle-eastern' | 'mixed' | 'other' | 'prefer-not-say',
  politicalParty: 'very-liberal' | 'liberal' | 'moderate' | 'conservative' | 'very-conservative' | 'independent' | 'other' | 'prefer-not-say'
}
```

### Form Design

**Visual Treatment:**
- Modal overlay (like post-poll prompt)
- 4 dropdown select fields
- Disabled submit button until all fields complete
- "See My Results" button (enabled when complete)
- "Why we ask" + "Privacy" links in footer
- Privacy assurance text

**Copy:**
```
Heading: "Help us understand our community"
Subtext: "Answer 4 quick questions to unlock your personalized voting profile"
Button (incomplete): "Complete all fields" (disabled, gray)
Button (complete): "See My Results" (enabled, purple)
Footer: "Your votes remain anonymous. We only use demographics to show group trends."
```

### Flow Logic

```javascript
// After 10th vote
if (!user.hasDemographics) {
  showDemographicsForm();
} else {
  showResults();
}

// After demographics submission
setHasDemographics(true);
showResults();
```

### Data Storage

```javascript
{
  userId: '...',
  hasDemographics: true,
  demographics: {
    gender: 'female',
    ageGroup: '25-34',
    ethnicity: 'asian',
    politicalParty: 'moderate',
    collectedAt: '2025-10-15T12:00:00Z'
  }
}
```

**Important:** Store `hasDemographics` boolean separately to quickly check if user needs the form.

### Privacy & Trust

**Transparency:**
- Explain WHY you need this data (in "Why we ask" modal)
- Show examples of insights they'll get
- Promise anonymity

**"Why We Ask" Modal Content:**
```
Title: "Why we ask for demographics"

Body:
- Understanding diverse perspectives: These questions help us 
  understand how different groups view important topics.
  
- Better insights: We can show you how your views compare to 
  others in your demographic group.
  
- Improving our analysis: Demographic data helps us identify 
  consensus and differences across communities.
  
- Your privacy: All responses are anonymous and used only for 
  aggregate analysis. We never link your demographics to your 
  individual votes.
```

### Completion Rate Expectations

- Target: 85%+ completion
- Acceptable: 75%+
- Concerning: <70% (indicates friction issue)

If completion rate is low, consider:
1. Simplifying questions
2. Better copy/messaging
3. A/B testing different approaches

---

## 7. Personal Insight Algorithm

### Logic
```javascript
if (agreePercent > 70) ‚Üí "The Optimist" üåü
else if (disagreePercent > 60) ‚Üí "The Critical Thinker" üîç
else if (passPercent > 40) ‚Üí "The Thoughtful Observer" ü§î
else if (|agrees - disagrees| <= 2) ‚Üí "The Balanced Evaluator" ‚öñÔ∏è
else ‚Üí "The Engaged Contributor" üí°
```

### When to Show
- ‚úÖ User voted 1+ times AND viewing Results
- ‚ùå User hasn't voted (show generic view)
- ‚ùå Poll is closed AND user never voted

**Why**: Insights are personal rewards. Don't fake them.

---

## 8. Authentication Strategy (Phase 1)

### The Principle: "Invite, Don't Gate"

**Don't block**: Let users experience value first  
**Do invite**: Show benefits at high-value moments

**Note:** Demographics collection is separate from authentication. Users can vote and provide demographics without creating an account.

### Auth Prompt Placement

1. **Home page**: Small "Sign Up" button (top-right) + dismissible banner (bottom)
2. **After first poll completion**: Modal with 3 benefits listed
3. **Inside profile card**: Small link "üíæ Sign up to save this profile"

### Prompt Timing
```
User votes on 1st poll ‚Üí Complete ‚Üí Modal appears
User dismisses banner ‚Üí Don't show again (this session)
User sees 3+ prompts ‚Üí Stop prompting (avoid nagging)
```

**Copy guidelines**:
- ‚úÖ "Save your voting profiles across topics"
- ‚úÖ "Get notified about new polls"
- ‚ùå "Sign up now!" (no urgency/pressure)
- ‚ùå "You need an account to continue" (don't block)

---

## 8. Mobile Optimization Checklist

### Typography
```css
/* Base pattern */
className="text-sm sm:text-base"

/* Headers */
className="text-2xl sm:text-3xl"

/* Buttons */
className="py-2.5 sm:py-3"
```

### Spacing
```css
/* Padding */
className="p-4 sm:p-6"

/* Gaps */
className="gap-2 sm:gap-3"

/* Margins */
className="mb-4 sm:mb-6"
```

### Icons
```jsx
<Icon size={16} className="sm:w-[18px] sm:h-[18px]" />
```

### Hidden Elements
```css
/* Hide on very small screens */
className="hidden xs:inline"
```

**Testing requirement**: Every screen must be tested at 320px width (iPhone SE).

---

## 9. Animation & Feedback

### Voting Flow Animations

**1. Statement Transition** (1 second)
```
Vote ‚Üí Stats appear on buttons ‚Üí Pulse animation ‚Üí 
Wait 1s ‚Üí Next statement
```

**Why 1 second?** 
- 800ms: Too fast, user can't read stats
- 1000ms: Perfect - time to process
- 1500ms: Too slow, feels sluggish

**2. Progress Bar**
Instagram-style segments:
- Completed: Full white
- Current: Animating fill
- Upcoming: Empty (30% opacity)

**3. Button Hover States**
```css
/* Disagree/Agree buttons */
hover: scale-up by 20% (flex-[1.2])
after-vote: scale to 110% + pulse
```

### Micro-interactions
- Card hover: `-translate-y-1` (lift effect)
- Button click: Scale pulse
- Stats reveal: Fade in + slide up

**Performance note**: Use CSS transforms (not position changes) for 60fps.

## 10. Data Structure Reference

### Poll Object (Complete)
```javascript
{
  id: string,              // Unique identifier
  title: string,           // Display name
  emoji: string,           // Visual identifier
  description: string,     // Subtitle
  question: string,        // Main prompt shown while voting
  participants: number,    // Total who voted
  statementCount: number,  // Total statements
  isClosed: boolean,       // Poll status
  closedDate: string|null, // "2025-10-01" or null
  statements: Statement[]  // Array of statements
}
```

### Statement Object
```javascript
{
  id: number,        // Unique within poll
  text: string,      // The statement text
  author: string,    // Who submitted it
  agree: number,     // Count of agrees
  disagree: number,  // Count of disagrees
  pass: number       // Count of passes
}
```

### User Vote State
```javascript
{
  [pollId]: {
    votes: { [statementId]: 'agree'|'disagree'|'pass' },
    currentStatementIndex: number,
    currentBatch: number,
    lastVisited: timestamp
  }
}
```

---

## 11. Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: Vote State Persists Across Polls
**Problem**: User votes on Poll A, clicks Poll B, sees Poll A's votes  
**Solution**: Clear votes on `handleSelectPoll()`
```javascript
setVotes({});
setRevealedStats({});
```

### Pitfall 2: Results Tab Accessible Before 10 Votes
**Problem**: Logic checks `votedCount < 10` but doesn't disable button  
**Solution**: 
```javascript
disabled={!canSeeResults}
className={!canSeeResults ? 'cursor-not-allowed opacity-40' : ''}
```

### Pitfall 3: Closed Poll Shows Vote Tab
**Problem**: Conditional rendering only checks `activeView`  
**Solution**: Check both `activeView === 'vote' && !poll.isClosed`

### Pitfall 4: Auth Prompts Spam User
**Problem**: Prompt shows after every action  
**Solution**: Track dismissals and completion state:
```javascript
const [hasCompletedFirstPoll, setHasCompletedFirstPoll] = useState(false);
// Only show modal once
```

### Pitfall 5: Mobile Buttons Too Small
**Problem**: Button text too small on mobile, hard to tap  
**Solution**: Minimum touch target 44x44px:
```css
className="py-3" /* ‚â• 44px height */
```

---

## 12. Testing Scenarios

### Critical Path Tests

**Test 1: Complete First Poll (New User)**
1. Land on home page
2. Click any open poll
3. Vote on 10 statements
4. Verify demographics form shows
5. Fill all 4 fields
6. Verify submit button enables
7. Click "See My Results"
8. Verify Results view shows
9. Verify personal insight appears
10. Verify post-poll modal shows (first time only)

**Test 2: Complete First Poll (Has Demographics)**
1. User already filled demographics
2. Vote on 10 statements
3. Verify NO demographics form shows
4. Verify goes directly to Results

**Test 3: Partial Voting (No Demographics)**
1. Start poll, vote 5 times
2. Leave and return
3. Verify Results still locked "(5/10)"
4. Vote 5 more
5. Verify demographics form shows
6. Complete form
7. Verify Results unlocks

**Test 2: Closed Poll Viewing**
1. Click closed poll
2. Verify redirects to Results (skips Vote)
3. Verify yellow closure banner shows
4. Verify no Vote tab exists

**Test 3: Partial Voting**
1. Start poll, vote 5 times
2. Leave and return
3. Verify Results still locked "(5/10)"
4. Vote 5 more
5. Verify Results unlocks

**Test 4: Batch System**
1. Vote on 10 statements (complete batch 1)
2. Go to Results
3. Click "Vote on Next Batch"
4. Verify new progress bar (starts fresh)
5. Verify continues from statement 11

### Edge Cases

- Empty poll (0 statements) - shouldn't exist
- Single statement poll - batch = 1, works normally
- User votes, poll closes, user returns - show partial message
- User completes all, poll adds more - "There's more!" shows
- Rapid clicking during vote animation - buttons disabled
- User refreshes during demographics form - save partial progress to localStorage
- User closes tab during demographics - on return, show form again
- User with demographics votes on new poll - skip demographics form

---

## 13. Performance Considerations

### Optimization Points

**1. Statement Rendering**
- Don't render all statements at once
- Only render current batch (max 10)
- Use `slice()` not `filter()`

**2. Image/Emoji Loading**
- Use system emojis (no image assets)
- Lazy load poll cards if list grows >20

**3. Animation Performance**
- Use `transform` not `margin/top/left`
- Use `will-change` for animated elements
- Debounce hover states

**4. State Updates**
- Batch state updates in vote handler
- Don't trigger re-renders during animation

### Bundle Size Target
- Initial load: < 100KB (gzipped)
- Full app: < 300KB
- No external dependencies except React + Lucide icons

---

## 14. Accessibility Requirements

### Keyboard Navigation
```
Tab: Move between interactive elements
Enter/Space: Activate buttons
Escape: Close modals
Arrow keys: Navigate statements (nice-to-have)
```

### Screen Readers
```jsx
// Voting buttons
<button aria-label="Agree with this statement">
  <ThumbsUp />
  Agree
</button>

// Progress indicator
<div role="progressbar" aria-valuenow={votedCount} aria-valuemax={10}>
  {votedCount} / 10 votes
</div>

// Locked Results tab
<button disabled aria-label="Results locked until 10 votes">
  Results (7/10)
</button>
```

### Color Contrast
- All text: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio
- Buttons: Minimum 3:1 ratio
- Disabled states: Clear visual distinction

### Focus States
All interactive elements must have visible focus rings:
```css
focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-purple-500
```

---

## 15. Future Considerations (Not in Scope)

### Phase 2 Features (Authenticated Users)
- Save voting history across devices
- Email notifications for new polls
- Create custom polls
- Follow specific topics
- Compare profiles with friends

### Phase 3 Features (Advanced)
- Real-time vote updates
- Opinion clustering visualization (Pol.is-style map)
- Statement moderation
- Multi-language support
- Export results as PDF

### Technical Debt to Address
- Local storage for anonymous users (resume sessions)
- Backend API integration
- Real authentication system
- Analytics tracking
- A/B testing framework

## 18. Key Takeaways for Developers

### What Makes This Work

1. **Simplicity First**: One action per screen, clear paths
2. **Mobile-Optimized**: Every decision considers thumb-reach
3. **Batch Mental Model**: 10 at a time, always
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show when relevant, not before
5. **Emotional Payoff**: Personal insights as reward
6. **Anonymous Default**: Auth is enhancement, not requirement

### What to Avoid

1. ‚ùå Don't add features "just in case"
2. ‚ùå Don't force login early
3. ‚ùå Don't overwhelm with too many statements
4. ‚ùå Don't hide poll status (open vs closed)
5. ‚ùå Don't spam auth prompts
6. ‚ùå Don't sacrifice mobile for desktop

### Philosophy

> "The best interface is the one that gets out of the user's way. Our job is to make voting feel effortless, not to show off features."

## Questions for Product/Engineering Sync

1. **Backend**: What's the API structure for polls and votes?
2. **Demographics**: How should we store demographic data? Separate table? Encrypted?
3. **Auth**: Using OAuth? Magic links? Email/password?
4. **Real-time**: Do votes update live or on page refresh?
5. **Analytics**: What events should we track? (votes, demographics completion, etc.)
6. **Notifications**: Email? Push? In-app only?
7. **Moderation**: How do we handle inappropriate statements?
8. **Scaling**: Expected concurrent users per poll?
9. **Data retention**: How long do we keep closed polls? What about demographics?
10. **GDPR/Privacy**: Do we need user consent for demographic collection? Data deletion process?

## Appendix B: Demographics Data Model

### User Object
```javascript
{
  userId: string,
  hasDemographics: boolean,
  demographics: {
    gender: string,

### Privacy Considerations
- Store demographics separately from individual votes
- Use aggregate queries only: "How many 25-34 year olds agreed?"
- Never expose: "User X is 25-34 and voted this way"
- Implement data retention policy (delete after N months?)
- Provide user data export/deletion on request (GDPR)

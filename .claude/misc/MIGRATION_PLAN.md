## Migration Overview

### Strategic Approach

**Method:** Parallel development with clean cutover
- Keep admin/manager interfaces completely untouched
- Build new voting UX components alongside old ones
- Single cutover point (swap routes when complete)
- Easy rollback if needed

### Success Metrics

- [ ] All voting user pages use mockup design system
- [ ] Single-page architecture with tabs functional
- [ ] All Hebrew strings implemented with correct terminology
- [ ] Demographics modal appears after 10 votes (not before)
- [ ] Admin/manager interfaces unchanged and functional
- [ ] All existing business logic preserved
- [ ] Zero database schema changes

---

## Pre-Implementation Checklist

### Before Starting Phase 1

- [ ] **Backup current branch** - Create backup of `ux-redesign` branch
- [ ] **Create Hebrew strings file** - `lib/strings/he.ts` with all terminology
- [ ] **Create design tokens v2** - `lib/design-tokens-v2.ts` with mockup styles
- [ ] **Update CLAUDE.md** - Document new terminology and architecture
- [ ] **Create test polls** - At least 3 test polls with different states:
  - New poll (0 votes)
  - In-progress poll (5 votes)
  - Completed poll (20+ votes)
  - Closed poll

### Environment Setup

```bash
# Already on ux-redesign branch
git status

# Ensure dependencies are up to date
npm install

# Test current build
npm run build

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Mock data and actions
- Focus on logic and rendering

### Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Test data flow between components
- Test state management

### E2E Testing
- Test complete user journeys
- Use Playwright (already set up)
- Test critical paths

### Visual Regression Testing
- Take screenshots of key pages
- Compare before/after
- Ensure no unintended changes

### Performance Testing
- Lighthouse audits
- Check bundle size
- Measure page load times
- Test on slow 3G

## Rollback Plan

### If Major Issues Found

**Quick Rollback (< 1 hour):**
```bash
# Revert to pre-redesign state
git checkout ux-redesign
git reset --hard <commit-before-phase-1>
git push -f origin ux-redesign

# Restart dev server
npm run dev
```

**Partial Rollback:**
- Keep Phase 1-2 (foundation + voting)
- Revert Phase 3-4 if demographics/results broken

### Emergency Hotfixes

Create separate `hotfix/` branch for critical bugs:
```bash
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-bug-description
# Fix bug
git commit
git push
# Create PR to ux-redesign
```

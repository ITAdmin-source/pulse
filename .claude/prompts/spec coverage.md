"Please analyze the provided codebase and create a comprehensive report that addresses the following:

1. **Coverage Assessment**: Evaluate how much of Use Case 4 (Admin & Manager Workflows) has been implemented in the current code. For each workflow component:
   - Identify which features/functions are fully implemented
   - Identify which are partially implemented (specify what's missing)
   - Identify which are not yet started

2. **Gap Analysis**: List all missing or incomplete functionality required to fully satisfy Use Case 4

3. **Implementation Plan**: Develop a detailed plan to complete the remaining work, including:
   - Prioritized list of tasks/features to implement
   - Estimated complexity or effort for each item
   - Suggested implementation order with dependencies noted
   - Any technical considerations or challenges to address

Please structure the report with clear sections and use specific examples from the code where applicable."

**Key improvements made:**
- Added structure with numbered sections for clarity
- Specified what "coverage" means (fully/partially/not implemented)
- Requested specific deliverables (gap analysis, prioritized tasks)
- Asked for actionable details (complexity estimates, dependencies)
- Requested clear formatting for easier reading

## Task 2.1: User Management Interface

**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 10-12 hours
**Complexity:** High

### Requirements

Build a centralized user management interface for system administrators with the following capabilities:

#### 1. User List Page (`app/admin/users/page.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Display all users (authenticated and anonymous) in a paginated table
- Show key information per user:
  - Email/Clerk ID (authenticated) or Session ID (anonymous)
  - User type badge (authenticated/anonymous)
  - Number of polls participated in
  - Total votes cast
  - Current roles (system_admin, poll_owner, poll_manager)
  - Account creation date
- Search functionality by email, Clerk ID, or session ID
- Filter options:
  - User type (all/authenticated/anonymous)
  - Has roles (all/admin/owner/manager/none)
  - Activity level (active/inactive)
- Pagination (20 users per page)
- Click user row to open details modal

#### 2. User Management Service (`lib/services/user-management-service.ts`)

**Required Methods:**
```typescript
class UserManagementService {
  // List users with pagination and filtering
  static async listUsers(options: {
    page: number;
    limit: number;
    search?: string;
    userType?: 'all' | 'authenticated' | 'anonymous';
    roleFilter?: 'all' | 'admin' | 'owner' | 'manager' | 'none';
  }): Promise<{
    users: Array<{
      id: string;
      email?: string;
      clerkUserId?: string;
      sessionId?: string;
      type: 'authenticated' | 'anonymous';
      pollsParticipated: number;
      totalVotes: number;
      roles: string[];
      createdAt: Date;
    }>;
    totalCount: number;
    totalPages: number;
  }>;

  // Get detailed user participation stats
  static async getUserStats(userId: string): Promise<{
    pollsParticipated: string[]; // poll IDs
    totalVotes: number;
    insightsGenerated: number;
    statementsSubmitted: number;
    roles: Array<{ role: string; pollId?: string }>;
  }>;

  // Assign/revoke system_admin role
  static async assignSystemAdmin(userId: string): Promise<void>;
  static async revokeSystemAdmin(userId: string): Promise<void>;
}
```

#### 3. User Details Modal (`components/admin/user-details-modal.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Display comprehensive user information:
  - Basic info (ID, email, type, created date)
  - Participation summary (polls, votes, insights)
  - Role assignments (with poll context)
  - Demographics (if provided)
- Actions available:
  - Assign/Revoke system_admin role (if current user is admin)
  - View user's insights (link to polls)
  - Export user data (future feature placeholder)
- Warning before assigning system_admin role
- Success/error toast notifications

#### 4. Server Actions (`actions/user-management-actions.ts`)

**Required Actions:**
```typescript
export async function listUsersAction(options: ListUsersOptions);
export async function getUserStatsAction(userId: string);
export async function assignSystemAdminAction(userId: string);
export async function revokeSystemAdminAction(userId: string);
```

### Implementation Notes

**Database Queries:**
- Join `users` with `votes`, `user_roles`, `user_poll_insights` for stats
- Use SQL COUNT for performance on large datasets
- Implement cursor-based pagination if user count > 10,000

**Permission Checks:**
- Only system_admin users can access this interface
- Middleware should protect `/admin/users` route
- Add permission check in each server action

**UI/UX Considerations:**
- Use data table component from shadcn/ui
- Loading skeletons during data fetch
- Empty state with helpful message
- Mobile-responsive design

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for UserManagementService
- Integration tests for server actions
- E2E test for user search and role assignment

## Task 2.3: Improve Manager Addition UX

**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 5-6 hours
**Complexity:** Medium

### Requirements

Replace the current text-input-based manager addition with an autocomplete user search component.

#### 1. User Search Autocomplete Component (`components/admin/user-search-autocomplete.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Search users by email or name (debounced, 300ms)
- Display matching results in dropdown:
  - User avatar (if available from Clerk)
  - Display name or email
  - User ID (truncated)
  - Current roles badge (if any)
- Select user from dropdown to populate selection
- Clear selection button
- Loading state during search
- Empty state ("No users found")
- Keyboard navigation (arrow keys, enter to select)

**Props:**
```typescript
interface UserSearchAutocompleteProps {
  onUserSelect: (user: { id: string; email?: string; name?: string }) => void;
  excludeUserIds?: string[]; // Don't show users already assigned
  placeholder?: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
}
```

#### 2. User Search Service Method

Add to `lib/services/user-service.ts`:
```typescript
static async searchUsers(query: string, limit: number = 10): Promise<Array<{
  id: string;
  clerkUserId?: string;
  email?: string;
  displayName?: string;
  currentRoles: string[];
}>> {
  // Search by email (from Clerk cache) or Clerk ID
  // Return users with their current roles
  // Limit results to prevent overwhelming UI
}
```

#### 3. Integration Updates

**Modify:** [app/polls/[slug]/manage/page.tsx](../../app/polls/[slug]/manage/page.tsx)

**Changes in Roles tab:**
- Replace current text input (line ~900) with UserSearchAutocomplete
- Update `handleAddManager` to work with selected user object
- Show selected user preview before adding
- Display error if user already has a role for this poll
- Better error messages (user-friendly)

**Before:**
```tsx
<Input
  type="text"
  placeholder="Enter user's Clerk ID or email"
  value={newManagerEmail}
  onChange={(e) => setNewManagerEmail(e.target.value)}
/>
```

**After:**
```tsx
<UserSearchAutocomplete
  onUserSelect={(user) => setSelectedUser(user)}
  excludeUserIds={pollManagers.map(m => m.userId)}
  placeholder="Search by email or name..."
/>
{selectedUser && (
  <div className="p-3 bg-blue-50 rounded">
    <p>Selected: {selectedUser.email || selectedUser.id}</p>
  </div>
)}
```

#### 4. Fix Existing Bug

**Issue:** Line 428 in manage page uses `getUserByClerkIdAction` incorrectly
```typescript
// Current (WRONG):
const userResult = await getUserByClerkIdAction(newManagerEmail.trim());
```

**Fix:** Use proper user search by email:
```typescript
// Fixed:
const users = await UserService.searchUsers(selectedUser.email || selectedUser.id, 1);
if (users.length === 0) {
  toast.error("User not found");
  return;
}
const userResult = { success: true, data: users[0] };
```

### Implementation Notes

**Debouncing:**
- Use `useDebouncedValue` hook or implement custom debounce
- 300ms delay to prevent excessive API calls

**Caching:**
- Consider caching search results in component state
- Cache Clerk profile data (already implemented in UserProfileService)

**Validation:**
- Check if user already has role before showing in results
- Prevent selecting current poll owner
- Clear selection after successful addition

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for searchUsers method
- Component tests for autocomplete (user interactions)
- E2E test for adding manager with autocomplete

---

## Implementation Order

### Recommended Sequence:

1. **Start with Task 2.3** (Manager UX) - Lower complexity, immediate UX benefit
   - Create UserSearchAutocomplete component
   - Add searchUsers method to UserService
   - Update manage page
   - Test thoroughly

2. **Then Task 2.1** (User Management) - More complex, builds on Task 2.3
   - Create UserManagementService
   - Build user list page
   - Create user details modal
   - Add server actions
   - Test with various user counts

### Time Estimate:
- **Task 2.3:** 5-6 hours
- **Task 2.1:** 10-12 hours
- **Total Phase 2:** 15-18 hours

## Architecture Guidelines

### Service Layer Pattern
Follow the established pattern in `lib/services/`:
- Business logic in services (NOT in actions or components)
- Services return typed data structures
- Error handling at service level
- Actions are thin wrappers around services

### Database Queries
- Use Drizzle ORM patterns from existing queries
- Leverage `db/queries/` for raw query functions
- Keep queries focused and performant
- Add indexes if querying large tables

### Component Structure
- Use shadcn/ui components for consistency
- Follow existing modal patterns (see `components/modals/`)
- Use Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Implement proper loading states

### Error Handling
- Toast notifications for user-facing errors (using sonner)
- Console.error for debugging
- Return `{ success: boolean; error?: string; data?: T }` from actions
- Graceful degradation (show partial data if possible)

### Type Safety
- Define TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Use Zod for validation where applicable
- Infer types from database schema using Drizzle
- No `any` types (use `unknown` if necessary)

---

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- All service methods in UserManagementService
- searchUsers method in UserService
- Autocomplete component logic

### Integration Tests
- Server actions (user list, stats, role assignment)
- Database queries with test fixtures
- Permission checks

### E2E Tests (Playwright)
- Admin user management workflow:
  1. Login as admin
  2. Navigate to user management
  3. Search for user
  4. Open user details
  5. Assign system_admin role
  6. Verify role assignment
- Manager addition workflow:
  1. Login as poll owner
  2. Navigate to manage page
  3. Search for user via autocomplete
  4. Add as manager
  5. Verify manager appears in list

## Additional Context

### Project Tech Stack:
- **Framework:** Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication:** Clerk (JWT-only, no webhooks)
- **UI:** Radix UI + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit/integration) + Playwright (E2E)

### Key Design Principles:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Service layer for all business logic
- Server components where possible (better performance)
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on error
- Accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Code Quality Standards:
- Run `npm run build` before committing (ensures TypeScript compiles)
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep components under 300 lines (extract helpers if needed)
- Use meaningful variable names (no abbreviations)

## Questions to Consider

Before implementing, think about:

1. **Scalability:** How will user list perform with 100,000+ users?
   - Consider virtual scrolling or cursor-based pagination
   - Implement backend search (don't load all users client-side)

2. **Security:** Are all endpoints properly protected?
   - Verify middleware protects admin routes
   - Check permission in server actions (don't trust client)
   - Audit log for sensitive actions (assign/revoke admin)

3. **UX:** What happens if user searches for themselves?
   - Should they be able to assign roles to themselves?
   - Show helpful message if trying to self-assign

4. **Edge Cases:** What if user has Clerk account but no email?
   - Display Clerk ID or "No email provided"
   - Handle gracefully in autocomplete

5. **Performance:** How to optimize database queries?
   - Use SELECT with specific columns (not SELECT *)
   - Add indexes on frequently searched columns
   - Cache Clerk profile data (already implemented)
